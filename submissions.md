Submission Notes

Given more time, what would you have done differently?
I spent the entire Fall 2020 semester learning React.js so I probably would have used that if I
had more time and less math homework but in the meantime I'm still much more used to Django
so I used that. I also would've liked to keep the database online.

How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?
I didn't match the font completely because eyeballing it would take too much time and
copying it straight from the Figma felt a bit like cheating.

Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
This project is pure Django. I imported the data into Django using importdata.py
as a custom command. Thanks :)
